2025 Workshop on "AI for understanding human behavior in professional settings" (BEHAIV) at the 2025 European Conference on AI - [ECAI2025](https://ecai2025.org/).

A substantial amount of research has been devoted to the role of AI in understanding and supporting people at their work. There are mature AI solutions to support medical practitioners for diagnosis, decision-making, treatment planning and patient monitoring; to support managers with logistics, decision-making, financial planning and auditing; and teachers with e-learning platforms and student performance assessment tools. However, many solutions, even interactive ones, can neither perceive nor anticipate the condition of the working professionals - including fatigue, distress, and cognitive overload.

Goal of BEHAIV is to bring together researchers working on AI in support of professionals, to understand their expectations and information demands during decision making, to help them anticipate signals calling their attention, to detect fatigue and disturbances, to promote safety and satisfaction at work. Examples of professionals are: teachers who need to deal with foundational models used by their students, teachers who want to exploit AI in their courses, doctors who interact with models during treatment planning, managers who receive AI-collected pieces of information and need to make reliable decisions on them.

## Workshop Programme

*(Please note that assignment of papers to sessions is still tentative)*

**SESSION 1 (9:00-10:30)**

* Keynote by **Jens Dörpinghaus** *The perception of AI in different labor market data*<br>
*Abstract*: This presentation will discuss how AI is described in various types of labor market data in Germany, including online social media, job advertisements, and continuing education data. We will also explore how people discuss AI in workplaces and educational settings for decision support, safety, and learning. The results show that AI is not considered the same way in all occupational areas and reveal a variety of aspects that could lead to further research.<br>
*Bio*: Dr. Jens Dörpinghaus is a lecturer (privatdozent) in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Koblenz and a researcher at the Federal Institute for Vocational Education and Training in Germany. His research focuses on AI and data science in computational social sciences and digital humanities.

## Submission Procedure:

Papers must be written in English using the [ECAI LaTeX template](https://ecai2024.eu/download/ecai-template.zip), prepared for single-blind reviewing, and not exceed 7 pages with an 8th page for references. Submissions are via easychair, following [this link](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=behaiv2025) (easychair account needed).

Supplementary materials are not permitted, but the authors are allowed to provide links to code or data. Inspection of these materials is at the reviewers' discretion, so the submitted papers must be self-standing. All submissions must adhere to the Ethics statement of ECAI 2025 (to be found under the [CFP of ECAI 2025 Main track](https://ecai2025.org/call-for-papers/)).

Accepted and presented BEHAIV papers will be published online in [CEUR-WS](https://ceur-ws.org/).
