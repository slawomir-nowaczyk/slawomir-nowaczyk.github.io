This year's workshop of [Swedish AI Society (SAIS)] will take place at [Halmstad University] on 16-17 June 2025.

SAIS workshops aim to bring together researchers and practitioners from the field of Artificial Intelligence to present and discuss ongoing work and future directions for AI. They provide a forum for networking among researchers as well as building links with related research fields, practitioners and businesses.

## Call for Papers
In the last years, research on Artificial Intelligence has made both academia and industry to take a more active role in engaging with the general public. The immense success of recent results appears almost endless, but they are not without faults or concerns. Addressing the role these technologies can have in human society is therefore important. The 2025 SAIS workshop, organised by the Swedish AI Society, invites researchers and industry practitioners working on all facets of AI to share their research.

Contributions are welcome from all areas of Artificial Intelligence, and topics of interest include:

* AI theory and applications
* AI ethics and regulations
* Human-centred AI
* Human-in-the-loop AI
* Case studies of AI
* Knowledge representation
* Hybrid and neurosymbolic AI
* Machine learning
* Complex systems and swarm intelligence
* Cognitive robotics and intelligent agents
* Planning and Scheduling
* Natural Language Processing
* Computer Vision
* Search Algorithms
* Multi-Agent-Systems

For the scientific program of the conference, we invite five types of contributions:

* 6-10 pages full paper describing original contributions that are not under review at another venue. This category will be published in SAIS 2025 proceedings at CEUR-WS, unless the authors opt-out.
* 3-5 pages general descriptions of current and ongoing projects, intended to disseminate work-in-progress results and undeveloped but interesting ideas; the goals is promoting awareness of research taking place within Sweden, and building up new collaborations. This category will not be included in the proceedings, only presented at the event.
* 2 pages extended abstracts of previously published papers in prestigious AI journals and conferences (within the last 12 months), intended to disseminate important ideas within Sweden. This category will not be included in the proceedings, only presented at the event.
* up to 2 pages descriptions of AI industrial applications and/or demonstrating use cases that leverage machine learning and AI techniques in a real-world setting. At least one author should be from industry. This category will not be included in the proceedings, only presented at the event.
* 2 pages extended abstract describing ongoing PhD projects (the first author must be a PhD student) as part of Doctoral Consortium, intended to gather feedback on problem statement and research questions, motivation, suggestions for new approaches, etc. This category will not be included in the proceedings, only presented at the event.
* until one week before the conference, we will also accept last-minute poster submissions of any AI-related content that would be of interest to workshop participants (submissions consisting of 0.5-1 page description will be continuously evaluated be Programme Committee members).

All submissions will be peer-reviewed by the conference program committee and accepted contributions will be part of workshop programme as oral presentations, practical demonstrations or posters.

Submission site will open on 2025-03-01.
