## Invited Speakers

![Kalle Åström](/assets/photos/KalleAstrom.png "Kalle Åström"){: style="float: left; width: 250px; margin-right: 1em;"}
**Kalle Åström**, Professor in Mathematics and Computer Vision at Lund University.

**Title:** AI Lund and Advances in Feature-Metric Learning for Vision and Audio

**Abstract:**
In this talk, I will present the AI Lund network at Lund University and discuss recent advancements in feature-metric learning for vision and audio, conducted within the Computer Vision and Machine Learning division of our department. AI Lund is an open network that fosters teaching, research, and collaboration across disciplines. I will outline its development since 2018 and highlight key initiatives.
While deep learning has significantly advanced recognition and generative tasks in images and audio, its application to mapping and positioning remains a challenge. However, recent progress in feature-metric learning has proven highly effective for feature extraction and geometric estimation. I will present key concepts in this new development and showcase examples of recent and ongoing research that push the boundaries of this field.
 
**Bio:**
Kalle Åström is a professor at the Centre for Mathematical Sciences at Lund University. His research spans from basic research in algebraic geometry, applied mathematical research and dissemination in industry and society as a whole. His master's thesis on autonomous vehicles was awarded first prize in Innovation Cup, 1991. The dissertation from 1996, won prize as best Nordic dissertation in machine learning and image analysis. He is the founder of several companies, Neuromathic, Spiideo, Cognimatics and Decuma, where Decuma won the EU's "IST grand prize" in 2005. He has been co-editor for IEEE transaction on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, and was the track chair for International Conference on Pattern Recognition in 2014. He has written about 230 reviewed scientific articles in scientific journals and conferences and has been main or co-supervisor for 30 PhD students. Currently he is coordinating the AI Lund network at Lund University.

**Benyou Wang**, Assistant Professor at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen.

**Title:** Towards Trustworthy Medical Large Language Models

**Abstract:**
Recently, OpenAI's ChatGPT and various open-source community models, such as LLaMA 3, have significantly advanced the development of AI applications. In the medical field, both proprietary and open-source models hold great potential. However, when it comes to solving real-world medical problems, there is still a "last mile" to cover. In this Speech, we will introduce our team's development of the medical large language model, HuatuoGPT, and its multilingual and multimodal extensions, the Apollo series. We will also discuss the technical solutions for HuatuoGPT-o1, which aim to enhance the performance and interpretability of large language models, particularly in the context of longer diagnostic reasoning chains. Finally, we will look ahead to the future development of medical LLMs. Specifically, we will explore the potential of using AIGC technology to create a large number of patient agents to train both human and AI doctors. By doing so, we can accumulate real patient needs and doctor feedback, ultimately working towards the development of generalist medical artificial intelligence (GMAI).

**Bio:**
Benyou Wang is an Assistant Professor and Presidential Young Professor at the School of Data Science, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen. He has received numerous awards, including the SIGIR 2017 Best Paper Nomination, NAACL 2019 Best Explainable NLP Paper, NLPCC 2022 Best Paper, and the EU Marie Curie Fellowship. He also served as the Website Chair for the EMNLP 2023 and the Publicity Chair for NLPCC 2023. His team has developed the medical LLM HuatuoGPT, the multilingual medical LLM Apollo, and the Arabic LLM AceGPT.

![Markus Lingman](/assets/photos/MarkusLingman.jpg "Markus Lingman"){: style="float: left; width: 250px; margin-right: 1em;"}
**Markus Lingman**, Chief Strategy Officer at Halland hospital group and adj. professor at Halmstad University information drive care, AI Swede of the year 2020.

**Title:** Routes to AI-driven value in health – when opportunity hits reality

**Abstract:**
Expectations and the promise of AI in health and care are great, but actual value delivered at scale is still limited. How can this be in a sector where demand is exceeding supply? In this talk I will provide an overview of the progress of AI  in care and aspects needed to acknowledge in order for researchers, innovators and entrepreneurs to thrive and contribute to the sector. I will discuss the AI infrastructure built in Halland and provide examples of how international collaboration can lead to new insights not achievable locally.

**Bio:**
Markus Lingman is adj professor of medicine at the Dept. Information technology at Halmstad University and researcher at Sahlgrenska Academy, Gothenburg. Insights from research are actioned in his role as Chief Strategy Officer of Region Halland. With a background as specialist physician and in healthcare management Markus´work revolves around the translation from care data to value for patients and providers. In 2020 he was named AI-Swede of the year by the Swedish medtech sector and in 2024 the National Government appointed member of the Scientific Council for Medicine and Health. Dominating current academic projects are on detection of risk for sudden cardiac death together with UC Berkeley, and identifying early exacerbation of chronic disease using smart watch data in collaboration with Stanford School of Medicine.

## Call for Papers
In the last years, research on Artificial Intelligence has made both academia and industry to take a more active role in engaging with the general public. The immense success of recent results appears almost endless, but they are not without faults or concerns. Addressing the role these technologies can have in human society is therefore important. The 2025 SAIS workshop, organised by the Swedish AI Society, invites researchers and industry practitioners working on all facets of AI to share their research.

Contributions are welcome from all areas of Artificial Intelligence, and topics of interest include:

* AI theory and applications
* AI ethics and regulations
* Trustworthy AI
* Human-centred AI
* Human-in-the-loop AI
* Case studies of AI
* Knowledge representation
* Hybrid and neurosymbolic AI
* Machine learning
* Complex systems and swarm intelligence
* Cognitive robotics and intelligent agents
* Planning and Scheduling
* Natural Language Processing
* Computer Vision
* Search Algorithms
* Multi-Agent-Systems

For the scientific program of the conference, we invite five types of contributions:

* 10-15 pages full paper describing original contributions that are not under review at another venue. This category will be published in SAIS 2025 proceedings at CEUR-WS, unless the authors opt-out.
* 3-5 pages general descriptions of current and ongoing projects, intended to disseminate work-in-progress results and undeveloped but interesting ideas; the goals is promoting awareness of research taking place within Sweden, and building up new collaborations. This category will not be included in the proceedings, only presented at the event.
* 2 pages extended abstracts of previously published papers in prestigious AI journals and conferences (within the last 12 months), intended to disseminate important ideas within Sweden. This category will not be included in the proceedings, only presented at the event.
* up to 2 pages descriptions of AI industrial applications and/or demonstrating use cases that leverage machine learning and AI techniques in a real-world setting. At least one author should be from industry. This category will not be included in the proceedings, only presented at the event.
* 2 pages extended abstract describing ongoing PhD projects (the first author must be a PhD student) as part of Doctoral Consortium, intended to gather feedback on problem statement and research questions, motivation, suggestions for new approaches, etc. This category will not be included in the proceedings, only presented at the event.
* until one week before the conference, we will also accept last-minute poster submissions of any AI-related content that would be of interest to workshop participants (submissions consisting of 0.5-1 page description will be continuously evaluated be Programme Committee members).

All submissions will be peer-reviewed by the conference program committee and accepted contributions will be part of workshop programme as oral presentations, practical demonstrations or posters.

Submission site will open on 2025-03-01.
