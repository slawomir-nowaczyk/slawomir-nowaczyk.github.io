The **Socially Responsible and Trustworthy AI Day** (co-located with [Swedish AI Society workshop 2025 in Halmstad](/SAIS-2025)) addresses the critical challenges surrounding the development and deployment of AI in a responsible manner. This event brings together experts from academia, industry, and law to explore the latest advancements and pressing issues in trustworthy AI.

The workshop will feature keynote presentations from domain experts including Rafia Inam (Ericsson), Kristina Knaving (RISE), alongside an interactive session on Bias on AI led by Amir Peybrah. Discussions will encompass both "high-risk" and "limited-risk" AI perspectives, and delve into emerging EU-level initiatives, including the EU AI Act.

A central component of the event is the panel discussion, "Impact of AI Regulation on Industry and Society," where subject matter experts will tackle key questions about the AI Act's impact on innovation, global regulatory interactions, the evolution of AI governance, and the role of academia in fostering trustworthy AI. The event also includes a poster session showcasing the latest research in the field.
The Socially Responsible and Trustworthy AI day aims to foster collaboration and knowledge exchange, connecting actors from academia and industry, and providing a platform for dialogue on the future of trustworthy AI.
