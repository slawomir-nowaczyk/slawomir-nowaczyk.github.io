## Travel to Halmstad

Here are some practical informations about how to get to and around Halmstad

To cycle or take the bus/drive between the town centre and Halmstad University only takes a few minutes, the distance is around two kilometres. The easiest way is to follow Laholmsvägen straight to [Halmstad University](https://maps.app.goo.gl/fw3k8GUuWtJw3Pnf8). The event will take place in Building S, room S1020, see our [Interactive campus map](https://use.mazemap.com/#v=1&zlevel=1&center=12.879556,56.662943&zoom=16.4&campusid=278){:target="_blank"}.

### By train
Train services will take you to central Halmstad. The train station is within walking distance to the centre of town. It takes about 10 minutes to walk to the University. Should you wish to take the bus instead, there are buses from the train station to most parts of town.

For information on train timetables, please see the train services' individual websites [Öresundstag], [SJ], [Krösatågen].

Please note that during SAIS workshop there are track works on the way between Halmstad and Göteborg, so account for additional 30-60 minutes.

### By car
If you're driving from Malmö or Göteborg, take the E6 motorway to the southern exit of Halmstad and then drive towards the town centre. After a few kilometres, you will see a tall glass building on the left hand side of the road. Turn left at the intersection by the building.

When you approach Halmstad from Växjö or Jönköping, take the E6 motorway southbound (towards Malmö), get off at the southern exit and then drive towards the town centre. Follow the instructions above.

There are several different parking lots around campus. Make sure to follow the instructions for the parking lot you are using in order to use the correct payment services. You can easily find car parks and charging points on our [Campus map].

### By plane
Halmstad airport is one of Sweden's most central airports, with flights to and from Stockholm. From the airport, you can get to town via bus or taxi. By car, it takes around 10 minutes from the town centre. Local bus route 40 stops just outside the terminal entrance.

When travelling to Halmstad from abroad, it is often easiest to fly to Copenhagen Airport (Denmark) and take the train directly to Halmstad. Look for a train going to Göteborg, which will stop at Halmstad along the way. [Halmstad airport]
