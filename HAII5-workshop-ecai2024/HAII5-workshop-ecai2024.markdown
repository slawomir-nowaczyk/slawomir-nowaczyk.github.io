## Workshop description
The workshop on Embracing Human-aware AI in Industry 5.0" is designed to delve into the evolving landscape of artificial intelligence in the industrial sector, placing emphasis on how AI should reflect and respond to human activities and demands. As industries worldwide transition into the realms of Industry 5.0, integrating AI technologies becomes not just an asset but a necessity. This shift heralds unprecedented opportunities and challenges, where the interplay between human workers and advanced AI systems takes centre stage. Our workshop aims to explore this critical intersection, focusing on how AI should be designed, implemented, validated and managed in a human-aware way.
Human-aware AI calls for novel solutions that allow humans and machines to collaborate seamlessly within the complexities of the real world, driving sustainability, resiliency, and benefits to people and society. In business branches like commerce, the need for human-aware AI is already taken for granted. Industry, including product design, manufacturing, aftermarket, maintenance and all forms of industrial engineering, seems to lag behind since the focus for many years has been pure automation. By delving into these topics with a human-aware lens, this workshop will significantly contribute to the ECAI conference, offering scientific discussions that align well with its themes and goals.

The workshop invites original work in the area and will feature a series of presentations from the contributing participants, two keynote talks, open discussions, and interactive panel sessions led by experts in the field of AI for Industry 5.0. We solicit submissions on a wide array of topics, ranging from ethical considerations and human-AI collaboration to AI-driven process optimisation, decision support systems, integration of domain and expert knowledge in AI algorithms and the future of work on the industrial floor. The workshop intends to foster a multidisciplinary dialogue on how AI can be human-aware and effectively integrated into various industrial processes by bringing together academicians, industry professionals, and AI practitioners. Particular emphasis will be placed on practical applications, challenges, and the latest research findings in the field.
Our objective is to provide a comprehensive platform for participants to gain insights into the current trends, potential benefits, and challenges associated with the deployment of AI in the industry in collaboration with and supporting (not replacing) humans – even on a cognitive level. The workshop is expected to spark innovative ideas, encourage collaborations, and contribute significantly to advancing human-aware AI in the industrial sector. Through this workshop, we aspire to shape the future of the industry where AI not only enhances efficiency and productivity but also aligns seamlessly with human needs and values.

The workshop will consist of two invited talks, technical presentations of contributed papers (primarily oral; however, we are open to the possibility of organising a poster session in case of a large number of high-quality submissions), and a panel discussion to summarise the discussions.
Papers presented at the workshop shall be submitted to CEUR-WS.org for online publication.

Sławomir Nowaczyk is a full professor in Machine Learning at the Center for Applied Intelligent Systems Research, Halmstad University, Sweden and a Research Leader for the School of Information Technology. He has a PhD degree from the Lund University of Technology. During the last decade, his research focused on knowledge representation, data mining and self-organising systems, especially in large and distributed industrial data streams, including unsupervised modelling. He was involved, often in leading roles, with over ten different industrial partners in over twenty research projects related to predictive maintenance, diagnostics and self-monitoring. He is a board member of the Swedish AI Society, served as a reviewer for 30 journals and 70 conferences, and has extensive experience in organising events, for example, the Scandinavian Conference on Artificial Intelligence 2015 in Halmstad; Transparent, Explainable and Affective AI in Medical Systems workshop at AIME 2019; three editions of IoT Streams for Predictive Maintenance tutorials and workshops at ECML 2019, 2020 and 2022; Summer School on Data-Driven Predictive Maintenance for Industry 4.0 and a related special session at DSAA’2021; XAI for Predictive Maintenance tutorial at KDD 2023; and XAI^3 Workshop at ECAI 2023 – which included editing 2-volume Springer proceedings “ECAI 2023 International Workshops,” for eight workshops. Sławomir was also an invited speaker, delivering the talk “Bridging Two Worlds - Navigating   Research Frontier and Real-World Relevance” at the 12th International Conference on Prestigious Applications of Intelligent Systems, PAIS 2023, co-located with ECAI 2023.
